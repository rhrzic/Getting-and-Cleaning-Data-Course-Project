The new dataset was created using the following steps:
1. Importing test and train data, each consisting of three txt files (subject, X and Y). Note that we did not use the Inertia Signals data at all.
2. Combining all the above data, assuming that rows were correspondent for the three files in each directory respectively.
3. Subsetting the complete dataset to only include only the  variables found in var_names.txt, that is means and standard deviations from the original dataset.
4. Finally, we summarized the data by grouping the data by subject and activity with the values of variables being the calculated mean of each of the grouping combinations.

For precise code used, please consult the run_analysis.R. It is extensively documented, so the code should be easy to follow.
For more information on the original dataset and how it was manipulated, check the CodeBook.Rmd file.
